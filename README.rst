Set Up Development Environment
------------------------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure you've installed:

-  Python 2.7.x development environment (virtualenv strongly
   recommended)

   *Hint*: See `runtime.txt`_ for the exact version
-  `Heroku Command Line`_

   All ``heroku`` commands can be performed through the Heroku web-based
   dashboard as well, if you don't want to use the CLI.

Set up
~~~~~~

1. Log in using the email address and password you used when creating
   your Heroku account:

   .. code:: sh

       heroku login

   Authenticating is required to allow both the ``heroku`` and ``git``
   commands to operate.

2. Add the Heroku app repo as a git remote:

   .. code:: sh

       heroku git:remote -a openedx-webhooks-staging

3. Verify that the remote is added properly:

   .. code:: sh

       git remote -v

   You should see output similar to:

   .. code:: sh

       heroku  https://git.heroku.com/openedx-webhooks-staging.git (push)
       heroku  https://git.heroku.com/openedx-webhooks-staging.git (fetch)
       origin  git@github.com:edx/openedx-webhooks.git (fetch)
       origin  git@github.com:edx/openedx-webhooks.git (push)

Develop
-------

This app relies on the following addons from Heroku:

-  PostgreSQL
-  Redis
-  IronMQ
-  Papertrail
-  Scheduler

While it's possible to replicate the entire stack locally, it'll be
difficult to ensure consistent experience for each developer. Instead,
we utilize the `pipeline`_ facility offered by Heroku to handle our
development needs.

The general development cycle is:

Code → Deploy branch to staging → Test → Iterate

To deploy a local branch to staging:

.. code:: sh

    git push heroku [branch_or_tag_or_hash:]master

Once you're satisfied with your changes, go ahead and open a pull
request per normal development procedures.

Run Tests
---------

.. code:: sh

    make install-requirements
    make test

Deploy
------

In most cases, you'll want to deploy by promoting from staging to
production.

**Prior to the promotion**, make sure all the changes have been merged
to ``master``, and you've deployed the ``master`` branch successfully to
staging.

The general workflow is:

Merge to ``master`` → Deploy ``master`` to staging → Test → Promote to
production

When you're ready to promote from staging to production:

.. code:: sh

    heroku pipelines:promote -r heroku
